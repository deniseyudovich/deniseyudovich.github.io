Hi! 
I am a fourth-year Astrophysics major and English minor at the University of Florida. I am interested both in plasma theory and mathematical/gravitational physics. I especially enjoy researching the role magnetic reconnection plays in creating stellar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), as well as the implications these events have on exoplanet habitability. My interest in gravitational physics lies primarily in understanding string theory through a mathematical lens.

More About Me:
Aside from physics, I enjoy reading (am always open to taking book recommendations), swimming, kayaking, and attending concerts.
I love animals, so one can often find me around pets and farm animals (I used to volunteer at a rescue farm).
