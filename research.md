# Projects:

1. My main work is analyzing the morphology of late-phase stellar flares from G-, K-, and M-type stars. Late-phase, or peak-bump, flares have a complex light curve morphology consisting of an impulsive peak followed by a gradual bump. These flares are highly energetic and pose important implications for habitability. After searching for the occurrence of these flares on cool stars, I analyzed their impulsive and bump profiles, finding important statistical relations between them. A first-author paper on this research has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ).

   
2. I also conduct research on Radio-loud (RL) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), specifically searching for their presence in galaxy cluster MACS J0242. This work sets the stage for examining the incidence of RL AGN across clusters of varying redshifts. This work is part of the larger effort to understand contamination in the early universe so that we can use cluster SZ (Sunyaev Zel’dovich) detections to constrain cosmic evolution.

   
3. As part of a separate research project, I explore the effect of black hole growth on submillimeter galaxies. I use the software _Caesar_ and _Powderday_ to run simulations and analyze this relation.

   
4. I also modeled and animated galaxies’ magnetic and kinetic energy densities using the platform _VisIt_. Using these models, I assessed the effects of stellar feedback, galaxy gas distribution, and galactic structure on magnetic and kinetic energy densities.
