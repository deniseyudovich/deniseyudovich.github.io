Welcome! I am a fourth-year Astrophysics major and English minor at the **University of Florida**. 




[//]: # I am interested both in plasma and flare physics, and mathematical/gravitational physics. I especially enjoy researching the role    [//]: # magnetic reconnection plays in creating stellar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), as well as the implications these  
[//]: # events have on exoplanet habitability. My interest in gravitational physics lies primarily in understanding string theory 
[//]: # through a mathematical lens.  




Aside from physics, I enjoy reading, swimming, cycling, kayaking, and traveling. I love animals, so one can often find me around pets and farm animals (I used to volunteer on a rescue farm).
