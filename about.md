Hi! I am a PhD student in the APS department at the University of Colorado Boulder. I majored in Astrophysics and minored in English at the University of Florida. I am interested in both mathematical/gravitational physics and plasma and flare physics. My interest in gravitational physics lies primarily in understanding black hole dynamics in the context of string theory. I also enjoy researching the role magnetic reconnection plays in creating stellar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), as well as the implications these events have on exoplanet habitability. 

More About Me: Aside from physics, I enjoy reading, swimming, cycling, kayaking, and traveling. I love animals, so one can often find me around pets and farm animals (I used to volunteer on a rescue farm).
